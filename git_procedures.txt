Steps to complete before end of break:

1) Fork my repository : github.com/developwithpassion/nbdn_prep.git
2) Create a clone of your repository using your private repository url
3) Do some refactoring of the prep exercise if you have some time!!


remember the following git commands:
-git add -A - adds all of the changes recursively
-git checkout -b {branch_name} -Creates a branch with the branch name
-git commit -m - Commits any changes to the branch you are on
-git checkout {branch_name} - switches you the branch 
-git merge {branch_name} - merges the branch_name with the current branch you are on
-git pull {remote_name} {branch_name} - pulls the version of the source from the specified remote for the specified branch

remember the checkin dance (keep in mind that I omitted the step of creating a branch to do the pull onto, as you don't have to)
-add
-commit
-pull remote changes
-merge any necessary conflicts
-push (if necessary)


Develop With Passion!!!!
